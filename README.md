# AI-Framework 🛡️ 🤖

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A simple, scalable methodology for AI-assisted development.

## Introduction

AI has transformed software development. What once took weeks now takes hours. But this speed creates new challenges: unclear requirements become expensive mistakes faster, context gets lost between sessions, and hard-won learnings disappear when conversations end.

AI-Framework solves these problems with a structured methodology that works for any project, any language, any team size. It focuses on the highest-leverage activities—research and planning—while providing patterns for context management, session continuity, and knowledge preservation.

This is not a boilerplate or template. It's an opinionated guide based on patterns proven across 50+ development sessions. Use what works for you, adapt what doesn't, and stay consistent.

## What makes a project "bulletproof"?

- **Clarity over speed** — Know what to build before building it
- **Signal over ceremony** — Capture learnings, not just status
- **Context under control** — Keep AI context under 40% for better reasoning
- **Knowledge compounds** — Every session makes the next one better
- **Verification at every gate** — Type check, lint, build, test

## Quick Start

1. Copy `templates/MASTER_REFERENCE.md` to your project
2. Fill in project-specific sections
3. Start every AI session by pointing to your MASTER_REFERENCE
4. Use `templates/TRANSFER_PACK.md` to hand off between sessions
5. Capture learnings in your MASTER_REFERENCE after each session
