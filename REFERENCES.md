## Methodology Sources

### FIC (Find → Implement → Compound)
- **Inspired by**: Dexter Horthy's "Research → Plan → Implement" pattern
- **Source video**: "Advanced Context Engineering for Agents"
- **Creator**: Dexter Horthy, Founder of Human Layer
- **Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS_y40zY-hc
- **Original insight**: Spec-first development, intentional context management, keeping context utilization under 40%
- **Adaptation**:
  - "Research" renamed to "Find" (same purpose: understand system, locate files)
  - "Compound" phase added for knowledge preservation and cross-session learning
- **Adapted by**: AI-Framework methodology

### S2S (Signal-to-Status)
- **Source**: "Agile is Dead, Long Live S2S"
- **Creator**: Zero to Pete
- **Link**: https://www.zerotopete.com/p/agile-is-dead-long-live-s2s
- **Key insight**: Focus on signals (decisions, learnings) over status updates

## Real-World Implementation

### SahmX
- **What**: Saudi Arabian real estate tokenization platform
- **Scale**: 3 production portals, 60+ day sprint to launch
- **Repo**: Private (methodology extracted into this framework)
- **Validation**: 340+ learnings captured, 50+ sessions managed
