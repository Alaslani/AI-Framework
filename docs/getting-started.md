# Getting Started

Get up and running in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

None. This is a pure markdown methodology with zero dependencies.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Copy the Master Reference Template

Copy `templates/MASTER_REFERENCE.md` to your project root.

### Step 2: Fill In Basics

At minimum, fill in:
- Project name
- Key URLs (repo, production, staging)
- Tech stack overview

### Step 3: Start Your First Session

When starting an AI session:
1. Point the AI to your MASTER_REFERENCE
2. State your task clearly
3. Follow the appropriate workflow (see below)

### Step 4: End Your Session

Before ending:
1. Create or update TRANSFER_PACK with session summary
2. Add any learnings to MASTER_REFERENCE
3. Note next steps

## Workflow Selection

| Task Type | Duration | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Quick fix | <50 lines, single file | Direct implementation |
| Standard task | 1 session | Plan briefly → implement |
| Multi-phase | 2+ sessions | Full FIC workflow |
| Complex feature | Multiple days | Research → Plan → Implement phases |

## Adoption Path

| Week | Focus | What to Do |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | FIC Workflow | Use Research → Plan → Implement for all non-trivial tasks |
| 2 | Context Management | Apply 40% rule, compact when needed |
| 3 | Session Handoff | Use Transfer Packs between sessions |
| 4 | Knowledge Persistence | Capture learnings systematically |

## Next Steps

- Learn the [FIC Workflow](methodology/fic-workflow.md)
- Understand [Context Management](methodology/phased-development.md)
- Set up [Session Handoff](patterns/session-handoff.md)
