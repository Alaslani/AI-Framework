# Exit Test

When is it OK to NOT use this framework?

---

## Don't Use FIC For

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| One-off scripts | No future sessions to hand off to |
| Throwaway experiments | Learning, not building |
| Hackathon spikes | Speed > sustainability (intentionally) |
| Tasks under 30 minutes | Overhead exceeds value |
| Solo exploration | You ARE the context |

---

## Do Use FIC For

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Production code | Must be maintainable |
| Multi-session work | Context will be lost |
| Team projects | Others need to understand |
| Anything with users | Stakes are real |
| Learning a new codebase | Find phase prevents mistakes |

---

## The Decision Rule

Ask: **"Will future-me or someone else need to understand this?"**

- Yes → Use framework
- No → Skip it

---

## Partial Adoption

You don't need all-or-nothing:

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Quick fix, want to remember why | Just Compound |
| Exploring unfamiliar code | Just Find |
| Know what to build, multi-step | Just Implement phases |
| Complex feature | Full FIC |

## Signs You Should Have Used It

- "Wait, why did we do it this way?"
- "Didn't we solve this before?"
- "What was the context for this decision?"
- Starting over because you lost track
